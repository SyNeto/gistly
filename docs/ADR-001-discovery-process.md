# ADR-001: Discovery Document Generation Process

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-09-16  
**Authors**: Development Team  

## Context

As the Gistly project grows and new features are added, we need a standardized process for documenting and analyzing new functionality before implementation. This ensures consistent quality, thorough planning, and reduces implementation risks.

## Decision

We will implement a standardized Discovery Document process for all new features before implementation begins.

## Discovery Document Structure

All discovery documents must follow this standardized structure:

### 1. Document Header
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Flows - Discovery Document

This document defines the [feature description] for the proposed `[command]` functionality in Gistly.
```

### 2. Required Sections

#### Table of Contents
- Complete navigation for all sections

#### Executive Summary
- Brief feature overview
- Proposed command syntax
- Key benefits and use cases

#### API Documentation
- GitHub API endpoints involved
- Request/response formats
- HTTP methods and status codes
- Authentication requirements

#### User Scenarios
- Comprehensive user flow scenarios
- Mermaid diagrams for complex flows
- Real-world examples with input/output

#### Edge Cases and Validations
- Error conditions and handling
- Input validation requirements
- Rate limiting considerations
- Security implications

#### Implementation Proposal
- Technical architecture
- Method signatures
- Integration points
- Testing strategy

### 3. Quality Standards

#### Technical Requirements
- All API endpoints must be documented with examples
- All user flows must include mermaid diagrams
- Error scenarios must be explicitly covered
- Performance considerations must be addressed

#### Documentation Standards
- Clear, concise writing
- Code examples for all scenarios
- Consistent terminology
- Proper markdown formatting

#### Review Criteria
- Completeness of scenarios covered
- Technical accuracy of API documentation
- Feasibility of implementation approach
- Alignment with project architecture

## Process Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery Creation
1. Create feature branch: `discovery/[feature-name]`
2. Generate discovery document in `docs/` directory
3. Follow naming convention: `[feature-name]-flows.md`
4. Include all required sections
5. Self-review for completeness

### Phase 2: Discovery Review
1. Technical review for API accuracy
2. UX review for user flow completeness
3. Architecture review for implementation feasibility
4. Security review for potential vulnerabilities

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning
1. Break down implementation into TDD cycles
2. Identify test scenarios from discovery
3. Plan integration points
4. Estimate implementation complexity

### Phase 4: Implementation Execution
1. Create feature branch: `feature/[feature-name]`
2. Follow TDD methodology (Red-Green-Refactor)
3. Implement according to discovery specifications
4. Update discovery document with implementation notes

## Benefits

### For Development
- **Reduced Implementation Risk**: Thorough planning prevents costly rework
- **Consistent Quality**: Standardized approach ensures all scenarios are considered
- **Better Testing**: Discovery scenarios directly inform test cases
- **Clear Requirements**: Eliminates ambiguity in feature specifications

### For Maintenance
- **Documentation as Code**: Discovery documents serve as living documentation
- **Historical Context**: Decisions and rationale are preserved
- **Onboarding**: New team members can understand feature design quickly
- **Future Enhancements**: Clear understanding of existing functionality

### For Project Management
- **Scope Definition**: Clear boundaries for feature implementation
- **Effort Estimation**: Better understanding of complexity
- **Risk Identification**: Early detection of potential issues
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear documentation for discussions

## Discovery Document Examples

Current discovery documents that exemplify this process:

1. **gist-update-flows.md**: Comprehensive update functionality with 12 scenarios
2. **gist-delete-flows.md**: Complete deletion flows with safety considerations

## Implementation Notes

### File Organization
```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ ADR-001-discovery-process.md     # This document
â”œâ”€â”€ gist-update-flows.md             # âœ… Implemented
â”œâ”€â”€ gist-delete-flows.md             # âœ… Implemented
â””â”€â”€ gist-list-flows.md               # ðŸ”„ Next implementation
```

### Naming Conventions
- Discovery documents: `[feature-name]-flows.md`
- ADR documents: `ADR-[number]-[topic].md`
- Implementation branches: `feature/[feature-name]`
- Discovery branches: `discovery/[feature-name]` (if needed)

### Integration with Development Workflow
1. Discovery creation is mandatory for all new features
2. Implementation cannot begin without approved discovery
3. Discovery documents are version controlled
4. Implementation updates must reference discovery sections

## Consequences

### Positive
- Higher quality implementations
- Reduced bugs and edge case misses
- Better documentation
- More predictable development cycles
- Easier code reviews and maintenance

### Negative
- Additional upfront time investment
- Potential over-engineering of simple features
- Need for discovery document maintenance

### Mitigation Strategies
- Keep discoveries proportional to feature complexity
- Regular review and updates of discovery documents
- Template and examples to reduce creation overhead
- Integration with existing TDD workflow
